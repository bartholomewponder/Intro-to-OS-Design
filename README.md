# Intro-to-OS-Design
Code listing from the book "Introduction to Operating System Design"

The book was written in the 1970's, and its age shows, since tape reels are the primary storage device mentioned. The book, like other contemporaries, was written in a Pascalesque pseudo-code, so most of my efforts here are to translate the contents into more modern C/C++.

I have three goals in mind with this project: 
  1. Translation, as a method of giving myself practice translating code from one language to another.
  2. Insight into the design of operating systems, old and new.
  3. General C/C++ practice.
